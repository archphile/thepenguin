## welcome to my blog!


My name is Mike and I am a passionate Linux user since 2003.

Long time ago I created [Archphile](https://archphile.org).

I spend most of my free time listening to music, shooting with my Fuji, torturing various ARM boards and flashing any device that accepts a custom firmware.

I read a lot on my kindle paperwhite and I'm obsessed with plain text productivity.

But that's enough about me. [Let's go to my posts!]({{< ref "blog" >}})
