My name is Mike and I am a passionate Linux user since 2003. Î™ love Linux Audio (long time ago I created the [Archphile Project](https://archphile.org)) and digital photography. 

I spend most of my free time listening to music, torturing various ARM boards and flashing any device that accepts a custom firmware.
