In my previous [post about photography] ({{< ref "2018-01-16-fuji-xt20-film-simulation-pack-for-capture-one.md" >}}), I showed you how to get **Fuji X-T20** film simulations for **Capture One**. In this one I will show you the same but for [Darktable ](https://www.darktable.org/) and [RawTherapee](http://rawtherapee.com/). Please note that all these styles are not only compliant with **X-T20** but they can be used with all **X-TRANS III** cameras.

### RawTherapee
Thanks to the amazing job by [Stuart Sowerby](https://blog.sowerby.me), our community has now available all currrent Fuji film simulations *(Provia, Velvia, Astia, Classic Chrome, Pro Neg Hi, Pro Neg Std, Acros, Acros + Ye, Acros + R, Acros + G, Mono, Mono + Ye, Mono + R, Mono + G and Sepia)*. If you visit [this link](https://blog.sowerby.me/fuji-film-simulation-profiles/) , you will find various different simulation packages suitable for different Raw editors. For **RawTherapee**, you need to donwload the following package:

- [Fujifilm-XTrans-III.zip](https://blog.sowerby.me/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fujifilm-XTrans-III.zip) 

- [Fujifilm-XTrans-III.zip](/download/Fujifilm-XTrans-III.zip) (Alternative Download Link hosted on my website)*

 Then you need to follow the instructions for [HaldCLUT](http://rawpedia.rawtherapee.com/Film_Simulation) .
 
 What I did in Archlinux was to extraxt the zip, then create a HaldCLUT directory under **~/.config/RawTherapee** and  set the HaldCLUT location in RawTherapee **Preferences**.

### Darktable
Thanks to [Andy Constanza](http://andycostanza.com/) and [Jean Paul Gauche](https://www.facebook.com/jeanpaul.gauche) , the styles above where converted for [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) You can get the styles below, extract the zip and import them using the styles module in lighttable tab :

 - [Fuji_XTrans_III_dtstyles.zip](https://darktable.fr/download/Fuji_XTrans_III_dtstyles.zip)
 
 - [Fuji_XTrans_III_dtstyles.zip](/download/Fuji_XTrans_III_dtstyles.zip) *(Alternative Download Link hosted on my website)*


As per [Stuart's Sowerby](https://blog.sowerby.me) usage notes:

>The simulations are designed to be applied to a neutral RAW file, this means no auto-levels or custom tone curves / contrast should be applied, although you can still use the exposure slider to correct initial brightness. Any processing to the image should ideally happen AFTER youâ€™ve applied the simulation or you may get unintended results.
