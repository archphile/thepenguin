## Instagram

Back in late 2017, during my first walks out as a completely new photographer, I had decided that whenever I found something really interesting, I would immediately transfer it from my camera to my smartphone and publish it on **Instagram**.

Some of my photos were really successful, while others did not get the "likes" I believed they would. That was the first time I caught myself deleting the content that my (few) followers - mainly friends of mine - didn't like.

This was **a really sad realization** for me: although I was an amateur photographer, my creativity was "being instructed" by my social media followers. Instead of learning how to shoot right and **make art** through photography, I had already decided that getting approval from my followers was far more important for me.


So in June of 2018, I decided that **Instagram** was harming the first real effort in my life on being creative and for this reason it had to be removed from my daily habits. As a result, my **Instagram** account was the first one to delete (after patiently deleting all my content). 

## Twitter

This decision had a deep impact on me, so I started wondering what was the actual reason I had a **Twitter** account. I always told myself that I used **Twitter** in order to get informed about what is happening in the world, but that was a lie. The reason I used twitter was in order to express my opinion (that nobody should give a fuck about) about everything, being forced from the maximum of the 140 characters to write in a "smartypants" way so that I **get re-tweets**.

I started reading all my past tweets and I felt sad. That was not me, but an impersonation of myself **seeking the dopamine that comes after the "reward" of a re-tweet**. Initially I decided to delete all my tweets and stay there only to follow accounts from news agencies etc., but I knew it was not enough. As a result I deleted my **Twitter** account.

## Facebook

My last remaining account was that of **Facebook**. Although I had lost my interest on Facebook long ago, I kept using it whenever I felt bored during the day, sometimes resulting in heavy use. In addition to that **Facebook Messenger** has become one of the most popular means of communication, and although I really didn't like it at all (I had many privacy concerns), I kept using it because it was the easiest way to chat with almost everyone I know. However, as my skepticism about social media was massively increasing, I started considering deleting my account. I decided to do the same I did with **Twitter**, so I started to read my content from the past.

I was a member of **Facebook** for more than nine years, so reading posts of my much younger self was a mixture of sad and funny feelings. One thing was for sure: that guy wasn't me and all these posts were 100% irrelevant to my current self. Apart from that, I started thinking of my past **Facebook** use. I remembered times I decided to delete content that got less likes than expected, or times I felt really nice because of a "successful" post. One word came again to mind: **dopamine**.

The days passed and I still hadn't decided what to do with this account, always telling to myself that not having a **Facebook**  account would affect communication with people I cared about. And then I asked myself "how many people will you lose if you stop using Facebook?". The reply was "ONE". So, I contacted this very old friend of mine, I informed her that she could not longer reach me over **Facebook** and apart from phone calls, she could either use Viber or Whatsapp to chat with me.

To cut the long story short, I decided once again to proceed with the usual step and I deleted my **Facebook** account along with my **Facebook messenger** one.


## Living without social media

I have to admit that I did not expect that deleting my social media accounts (apart from **Linkedin** which I am still obliged to have and occasionally use for business reasons) to change my life so drastically.

The first days without all these apps on my smartphone I felt really funny. I kept opening the screen of my smartphone realizing that I could not spend my time by infinitely scrolling my **Facebook** or **Twitter** feed. So, I decided to **replace an old habit with a new one** and **I started reading** electronic books. After 2 months of almost being addicted to reading, I bought a **Kindle**. After all these months, I only use my smartphone when needed (and mainly for my **GTD** system).

Regarding all the information that is not served on my feeds, I now visit all the pages I want (news, entertainment etc.) **whenever I want**. 

Not being continuously bombarded with low-quality content makes me feel much calmer and focusing to what is really important in REAL life. 

In addition to that, I started using **Reddit**. Although I don't consider it a social medium, **Reddit** can be as harmful (it has their own implementation of like named "karma") as all these other services above, but being more like a **multi-forum** platform, if you use it right it can be a very valuable resource of knowledge. Some subreddits I follow are r/simpleliving, r/minimalism, r/Anticonsumption, r/socialmediasceptisicm, r/digitalminimalism, r/gtd, r/photography, r/Buddhism etc.

In order to publish my photos, I used **Flickr** for a while, but I decided to create my own site for this reason, so I deleted **Flickr** too.

I keep having communication with all the people I want and the most important is that **I spend far less time on my smartphone** and online in general. This last behavior change was big **life changer**, but let's talk about it on a separate post!

What is really important is that **I feel that I escaped from dystopia**. I miss **nothing** from my old social media days.

Social media are **addictive on purpose**; they were created to be this way. Their whole purpose is to **modify our behaviors** and **manipulate us** in order to **addict us as much as possible** and finally **sell our data** (being addicted, we keep giving more and more data..) to advertisers (this is the best scenario!), manipulators/bad actors in general.

It is easily understood that setting ourselves free from the social media addiction can only make our lives better!
