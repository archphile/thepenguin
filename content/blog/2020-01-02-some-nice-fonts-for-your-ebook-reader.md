Happy new year everyone!

During the Christmas holidays, I spent some time trying to find an alternative to Bookerly font, which I have been using on my Kindle Paperwhite since day one.

After trying a lot of different alternatives, I ended up with the following ones, which you can download and test them yourself:

- [Linux Libertine](/download/fonts/Libertine.zip) *([source](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291521))*
- [Google Literata](/download/fonts/Literata.zip) *([source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-literata/))*
- [Noto Serif](/download/fonts/NotoSerifEink.zip) *([source](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3492137&postcount=387))*
- [Charis SIL](/download/fonts/ChareInk%20NoWeight%20v1.1.zip) *([source](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=184056))*
- [Bitter ht](/download/fonts/bitter-ht-regular-italic-bold-bold-italic.zip) *([source](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/bitter-ht))*

If you use a Kindle, just unpack the zip, and put the fonts inside  the  **"fonts"** folder.

If you don't have a Kindle and want to use the best kindle font on your e-book reader or app, you can get it using the following link:

- [Bookerly](/download/fonts/Bookerly.zip) *([source](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-bookerly/))*

As I am writing this words, the font of my preference is **Linux Libertine**. 

In the screenshots below, you can see the difference between Bookerly and the rest of the suggested fonts:
