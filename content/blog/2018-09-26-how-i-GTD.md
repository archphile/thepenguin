Back in June, I wrote [a post]({{< ref "2018-06-06-how-to-use-a-simple-text-based-todo-list-to-get-things-done.md" >}}) about [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) and I gave some general information on various applications that support it. 
In this post, I will focus on [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/), the methodology behind todo.txt, and how I use it in order to get things done. 

**Note:** If you don't have any idea about GTD or you want to  remember the most important elements of this system, then you should visit and read this amazing summary:

[ GTD in 15 minutes â€“ A Pragmatic Guide to Getting Things Done](https://hamberg.no/gtd/)  

Let's start...

## The book

[David Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Allen_(author)) wrote [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=10R2JXHRY4DYH1B1QD63) (this is the 2015 revision) many years ago, explaining everything about a complete system on getting things done. I decided to read it after I started using GTD, to ensure that I will avoid mistakes and take advantage of all David Allen's techniques and "secrets". What I immediately noticed is that David Allen is an **analog person**. He things analog, he uses paper and pencil, tickler folders etc. This is not bad, but...thinking this way, sometimes it makes things complicated. In practice, **GTD is far easier** comparing to what someone initially believes about it after reading the book.

## The required lists

Based on the book, in order to use the GTD system we need to at least have the following lists:


>1. Inbox
>2. Next actions
>3. Waiting for
>4. Projects
>5. Someday/maybe

And this is where it gets complicated. For someone like me who struggled his whole life to properly use one todo list, **keeping 5 interdependent lists is a no-go!**

## But we need these separate lists for GTD, don't we?

No, we don't! The only reason that David Allen suggests 5 separate lists, is because he thinks of 5 different paper lists (and this is why the author being an "analog person" makes things complicated..).

## So, what do we need to use GTD with an easier and more efficient way?

What we need is what [Gina Trapani](https://ginatrapani.org/) suggested in[ todo.txt format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).

Using todo.txt we only need **one txt list** and this list will include everything!

## Everything in one list

With todo.txt we identify contexts with **@**. In the example below:

>Discuss with John about Mary @calls
	
using **@calls** we know that this task is about **calls** context.

If what we want to discuss with John, is about a project named "foo", then all we have to do is use symbol **+**:

>Discuss with John about Mary @calls +foo

With one task in one list, we know both about the context and project.


## But what about inbox, waiting for and someday/maybe lists?

Inbox, waiting for and someday/maybe, can also be identified with a **@**:

>clean the house @inbox
>
>Buy a bicycle @someday/maybe
>
>@waitingfor Tina to inform me about Saturday's party
	

## What about ticklers?

Ticklers can also be in the same list. We just need to set a due date for them:

>John's birthday @ticklers due:2018-12-05
	
Note: It is obvious, that a due date is in theory not a "reminder" date. However, as we need to keep it simple, this is the most obvious way to read a tickler on a specific date using todo.txt.

## What I do

### "contexts" (including all the additional "lists")

These are the main contexts and addiitonal lists I use:

- anywhere
- appointments
- calls
- emails
- errands
- goals
- home
- housework
- laptop
- meetings
- out
- pc
- reading
- smartphone
- someday/maybe
- ticklers
- waitingfor
- websearching
- writing

### projects

I don't have many projects. Typically, if something requires more than one task to be completed, it should be a project, but I try to only use **+name_of_project** only for important projects of my life.

### due dates

I only use due dates for tasks that have to be completed due to a specific date. It's very important to use due dates only when needed! For the rest I use priorities.

Scheduled days are not supported on todo.txt. For this reason, I have expanded the due date use, in order to include them. This means that I also add tasks regarding appointments, meetings etc (events with a very specific time and date) using due dates too.

### priorities

I use from A to D:

- priority **A** for **today**
- priority **B** for the next **2 days**
- priority **C** for **this week**
- priority **D** for **this month**

### daily use

I wake up very early and when the coffee is ready, I open [Qtodotxt](https://github.com/QTodoTxt/QTodoTxt) on my Linux PC.

What I mainly do is:

- I modify tasks with **@inbox**, using the appropriate context, priority etc.

- I read the tasks with priority **B** and **C** and modify the ones I decided I will do today, giving them a priority **A**.

- I have a look at the tasks that are due today and do the appropriate modifications, ex. I modify a task regarding a cancelled/rescheduled appointment etc..

If I have a tickler due date, I may need to modify it and make it an actual task. So if the tickler is about someone's birthday, I will modify it using @calls context so that I will give a call later this day.

All tasks with an **A priority** and the **ones that are due today**, is my task list  for  today!

For the rest of the day, I mainly use [Simpletask (Owncloud version)](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android):

- I mark tasks as completed
- I modify priorities for tasks that I later decide I won't proceed with
- I write down everything I believe I should do using @inbox (if it's urgent or if I have some free time, I don't put it in inbox - I use the appropriate context, priority etc.)

**Note:** I try to **avoid having a huge todo list**. Before writing down a task, I try to **do it NOW** If it's not a quick task or if I don't have the time for it, this is when I proceed with writing a task on my list.

### inbox processing - weekly review


- I do the weekly review every Friday after work. I spend approx. 30 minutes on it, reading each one of my tasks, correcting mistakes, changing priorities etc..

- I mainly process my inbox every morning. If I want to add an urgent task, I bypass  **@inbox**. Instead, I use the appropriate context/project and priority or due date for it.

- For papers (bills, receipts, business cards etc.) I have a box at the office where I throw everything in. I open this box organize these papers every Monday morning.

### keeping notes for specific tasks

There are times when I need to keep notes for a specific task, ex:

- for a supermarket list
- for a "before a trip" checklist
- etc..

For this purpose I use my own implementation and the tasks are like below:

>(A) go to the supermarket [n:26] @errands 
>
>checklist for Barcelona trip [n:28] @smartphone
	
**[n:26]** and **[n:28]** refer to **note 26** and **note 28**. All these notes, are txt files kept in a very specific location on my personal cloud (Nextcloud) and are named like the examples below:

>26 - supermarket-2018-09-25.txt
>
>28 - barcelona-checklist.txt

When I no longer need these files because they refer to a completed task, I throw them under a subfolder named **done**.

Please note that this is **a completely personal approach** on keeping notes for tasks!

### using a calendar

If a task on my todo.txt list has a due/scheduled date (for me it is usually an appointment or meeting - remember that I use due dates for scheduled events too!), which means that it has a due date and very possibly a specific time slot, I use the calendar button of Simpletask and add it on my personal calendar (I use [simple calendar](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar) syncing on my Nextcloud calendar).

**Note:** For a standard GTD procedure, only adding such tasks on the calendar is enough. However I prefer to have everything on my todo.txt, and only use the calendar to get a generic day/week/month overview.

## keeping everything in the cloud

My todo.txt file "lives" in my personal cloud using [Nextcloud] ({{< ref "2018-06-17-how-to-set-up-your-own-cloud-using-nextcloud-on-archlinux.md" >}}). When I edit my task list from my PC,  [Simpletask (Owncloud version)](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android) immediately updates the list on my Android smartphone. 
In addition all my txt notes, important scanned documents, calendar, are on the cloud too, so that I can have access wherever I am.

**Note:** If you don't want to mess around with Nextcloud, you can do the same with Dropbox.


## Why using one list for everything works

The reason one list for everything does the job perfect is because **it is simple** and **easy to maintain**.

Respecting **todo.txt format** allows us to use apps like [Simpletask](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android) and [Qtodotxt](https://github.com/QTodoTxt/QTodoTxt) and **sort or filter** per anything we want, immediately! This way **we have many lists existing within a master list**. 

## Example

This is an example of a todo.txt list in it's complete format:

>(A) 2018-09-24 go to the supermarket @errands
>
>(A) 2018-09-24 call John to discuss about tomorrows meeting @calls
>
>(D) 2018-09-01 send Tina the cake recipe @emails
>
>2018-09-24 fix tv @inbox
>
>2018-09-20 @waitingfor Nick to give me the laboratory results +foo_project
>
>2018-09-10 Mary's birthday @ticklers due:2018-12-05
>
>2018-09-01 by a bicycle @someday/maybe


This is what we see using **Simpletask**:

Finally, this is the list overview using **Qtodotxt**:

![Qtototxt overview](/img/qtodotxt-overview.jpg) 

It's obvious that using these programs we can do everything with one list, as all GTD lists exist within our main todo.txt masterlist!

## En experiment using spreadsheets

During the summer, I decided to google and find out how people are using **GTD with spreadsheets**. To my surprise I realized that most of the implementations were structured "by the book", using many tabs with separate lists/sublists etc., resulting in huge and difficult to use sheets.

So I tried to implement a spreadsheet based on todo.txt approach, again using **one list for everything**. You can download the result of this effort by visiting my [github repository](https://github.com/archphile/GTD). 

## Summary

In this post I tried to explain how GTD works for me in order to give ideas to other people struggling to find their own methodology and tools. I believe that in order for someone to keep using GTD, **it has to be simple**. Keeping one master list with [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) is the first step to a [K.I.S.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) GTD approach.
