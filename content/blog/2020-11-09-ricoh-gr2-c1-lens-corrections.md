I have been shooting with a **Ricoh GR II** for the last two years. The GR II has an amazing (for the money) wide lens that produces very sharp images but it also has some **distortion** that can affect the look of specific photographs.

Rico's **RAW** files make a great combo with **Capture One**, but since day one I noticed that the latter does not apply any **lens correction**. When a GR II RAW (**.DNG**) is opened with **C1**, the lens correction section by default is like below:

The GR II has minor differences when compared with its predecessor Ricoh GR and both of these cameras share the same lens. So, a quick and effective workaround to correct the distortion is to use the C1 preset made for the GR:

Note that these settings can be saved as a preset and that this preset can also be set as default for files from this camera. However I still prefer to apply it manually.
