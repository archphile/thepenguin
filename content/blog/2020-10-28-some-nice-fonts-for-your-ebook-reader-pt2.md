Back in January, [I wrote a post]({{< ref "2020-01-02-some-nice-fonts-for-your-ebook-reader" >}}) about the fonts I used on my e-ink device (Kindle Paperwhite).

Since then, my preferences have changed and below you will find the fonts I currently use:

- [Baskerville](/download/fonts/Baskerville.zip) *([source](https://apkpure.com/amazon-kindle/com.amazon.kindle))*
- [Lexend Deca](/download/fonts/Lexend-Deca.zip) *([source](https://github.com/ThomasJockin/lexend))*
- [Didact Gothic](/download/fonts/Didact-Gothic.zip) *([source](https://github.com/ossobuffo/didact-gothic))* 
- [Verdana Pro Condensed](/download/fonts/Verdana-Pro-Condensed.zip) *([source](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/verdana-pro/9n8d67vhhdc2?activetab=pivot:overviewtab))*

If you use a Kindle, just unpack the zip and put the fonts to **"fonts"** directory.

**Notes:**

1. **Baskerville** is already included in kindle devices. However, I got it from the Android **.apk**, and I added a download link above, so that users of other e-ink devices can test it too.

2. [Lexend Deca](https://www.lexend.com/) was explicitly designed to improve reading speeds. It's a very interesting font and you should definitely give it a try!
